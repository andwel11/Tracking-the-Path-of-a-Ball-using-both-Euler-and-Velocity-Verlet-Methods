# Tracking-the-Path-of-a-Ball-using-both-Euler-and-Velocity-Verlet-Methods
This code will model the trajectory of a projectile with no drag starting from the ground, with an initial speed of 10m s^-1 at 30 and 60 degrees from the horizontal at initial time, t0 in steps dt until final time, tf is reached using Euler and Velocity Verlet
